Education
======
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, Emphasis on Robotics and Controls, University of Wisconsin Madison, 2028 (expected)
* B.S. in Robotics Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, 2022
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, 2022

Highlighted Academic Experience
======
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Madison, WI - Sept 2023 to present
  * **Residual Learning MPC-CBF Framework for Safe Maritime Navigation** (MPC = model predictive control; CBF = control barrier functions). Aimed at creating a highly robust and safe motion planning and control system that can effectively handle model uncertainties and environmental disturbances in real-world marine environments. Advisor: Prof. Wei Wang
  * Co-author: **Energy Accumulation and Power Amplification via Pneumatic Augmentation.** A novel pneumatic augmentation to traditional electric motor-actuated legged robot to increase intermittent power density to perform infrequent explosive hopping behaviors.
* University of Califonia Santa Cruz
  * **Senior Theis** -- “Gesture Based Control of the Sawyer Robot through ROS”. Designed and implemented a HRI (human-robot interaction) system for Sawyer robot arm (High DoF Robotic Arm) to mimic real-time operator gestures using IMU sensors. Design of sensor subsystem, conversion of sensor measurements to task space, communication with robot for real-time robot pose control through ROS.
  * **Capstone Project** -- CPSRC Drive-by-Wire. •	Team of 5 cross-disciplinary engineering students created a drive-by-wire autonomous system for a Polaris GEM e2 vehicle. My role was to implement the embedded systems, firmware, and algorithms to control the vehicle’s actua-tors; and to conduct system characterization & identification (including dynamic models) for steering and breaking. I used automotive grade microcontrollers and a variety of sensors programmed in C intended to control the vehicle from a joystick. I used 3D printers and laser cutters to manufacture components not commercially available.
* REU
  * Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD (Lab for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR)) Individual Project “Bio-Inspired Soft Robot for Mud Traversal”. Developed (designed, fabricated, and tested) a unique soft-robot inspired on mudskippers, ropefish, and bichirs for use in deformable terrain. It uses synchronized pneumatic actuators.
  * 2-	UCSC, Hybrid Systems Lab (Electronics and Computer Eng.) (Sponsor: Prof. R. Sanfelice) Team Leader CPSRC Drive-by-Wire	Sept – Dec 2022 Further implementing a Drive-by-Wire system into a vehicle (Polaris Gen m2) as a testbed for self-driving vehicles; Implementation of safety critical hardware and software design.
